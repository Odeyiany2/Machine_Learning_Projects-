## BCG FORAGE JOB SIMULATION
In this program, I will be working as a Junior Data Scientist at BCG GAMMA. 
Below is a work flow of what I will be doing:
* Business understanding & problem framing: what is the context of this problem and why are they trying to solve it?
 
* Exploratory data analysis & data cleaning: what data are we working with, what does it look like and how can we make it better?
 
* Feature engineering: can we enrich this dataset using our own expertise or third party information?
 
* Modeling and evaluation: can we use this dataset to accurately make predictions? If so, are they reliable?
 
* Insights & Recommendations: how we can communicate the value of these predictions by explaining them in a way that matters to the business?
